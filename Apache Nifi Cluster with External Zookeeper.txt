ZooKeeper Configuration
"zoo.cfg" file

Next we need to create three config files. In the conf directory of zookeeper-1, create a zoo.cfg file 
with the following contents:

	tickTime=2000
	dataDir=/usr/local/zookeeper1
	clientPort=2181
	initLimit=5
	syncLimit=2
	server.1=localhost:2888:3888
	server.2=localhost:2889:3889
	server.3=localhost:2890:3890
Because we are running multiple ZooKeeper servers on a single machine, 
we specified the servername as localhost with unique quorum & leader election ports (i.e. 2888:3888, 2889:3889, 2890:3890) 
for each server.X.

Create similar zoo.cfg files in the conf directories of zookeeper-2 and zookeeper-3 
with modified values for dataDir and clientPort properties as separate dataDirs and distinct clientPorts are necessary.

"myid" file

Every machine that is part of the ZooKeeper ensemble needs to know about every other machine in the ensemble. 
As such, we need to attribute a server id to each machine by creating a file named myid, one for each server,
 which resides in that server's data directory, as specified by the configuration file parameter dataDir.

For example, create a myid file in /usr/local/zookeeper1 that consists of a single line with the text "1" and 
nothing else. Create the other myid files in the /usr/local/zookeeper2 and /usr/local/zookeeper3 directories
 with the contents of "2" and "3" respectively.

Note: More information about ZooKeper configuration settings can be found in the ZooKeeper Getting Started Guide.

ZooKeeper Startup
Start up each ZooKeeper host, by navigating to the /bin directory of each and applying the following command:

	./zkServer.sh start
NiFi
NiFi Configuration
For a two node NiFi cluster, in each conf directory modify the following properties in the nifi.properties file:

	nifi.state.management.embedded.zookeeper.start=false
	nifi.zookeeper.connect.string=localhost:2181,localhost:2182,localhost:2183
The first property configures NiFi to not use its embedded ZooKeeper. 
As a result, the zookeeper.properties and state-management.xml files in the conf directory are ignored. 
The second property must be specified to join the cluster as it lists all the ZooKeeper instances in the ensemble.
