Apache Nifi: Notes
-----------
Example 8: Adding Process Group
--Drag a process group to canvas and name it [say CSV to JSON]
--now select all processors which will be added to this process group.
--drag the processors onto the process group.
--double click on process group to look into it to see all processors.
--anytime ,right click and 'leave group' option allows you to come out of process group.

#creating a duplicate process group
--Right click on process group and click on copy.
--Then paste on canvas and this creates a duplicate of processgroup.
--Rename it to [say CSV to JSON-2]


#communicating between process groups.
Lets split CSV to JSON-2 into two separate process groups.
ie output of process group 1 ---> input to process group 2

Process Group-1 ("CSV to JSON-2")
GenerateFlowFile
ReplaceText
ExtractText
ReplaceText


Process Group-2 ("Write Json to filesystem")
UpdateAttribute
PutFile
LogAttribute

--add a new process group and name it [Say "Write Json to filesystem"]
--remove connection between ReplaceText and UpdateAttribute 
--select UpdateAttribute, PutFile & LogAttribute and drag them onto new Process Group.
--since new process group is inside old process group, its not loosely coupled.Thus let's keep both the process groups
  parallel to each other
--right click on new process group and select > move to the parent group
--using input and output port create a connection between two process groups.
--for process group 1 add a output port and create connection from ReplaceText to output.
--for process group 2 add a input port and create connection from input to UpdateAttribute
--now create a connection between both process groups and test your flow
====================================
Example 9:
Using/creating templates:
--select components(processors) to be as part of template
--select template option from [operate]--give a name and description
--we can also select process group and create a template.
--template created is kept in local NIFI instance
--Download templates from top right corner

#Importing and using already created template
or using other flows created : https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NIFI/Example+Dataflow+Templates
--download Retry_Count_Loop template
--upload template [operate menu]
--once uploaded, we can drag and drop template from top and select the one which was recently uploaded
========================
Example 10: Using Funnel

To connect output port to input port, they need to belong to 2 different process groups.
Thus it can get very complicated when number of processors increase and when input-output-input flow has to be used.
This might also lead to create multiple process groups.

--Add GenerateFlowFile processors (2)
  configure them to have RunSchedule: 10 sec
                         File Size : 1B
			 Unique FlowFiles : True
--connect them to Output port [OutputNew]
--Now add an input port on Canvas
--Add a LogAttribute Processor and let Input connect to LogAttribute
NOte** if we try to connect output port to input port, it won't allow unless they belong to 2 different process groups.


#Instead: Use Funnel
--delete the output and input ports
--add funnel 
--create connections from processors to funnel
