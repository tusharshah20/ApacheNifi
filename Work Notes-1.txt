PQ1: Why to avoid large clusters
--------------
First of all its unlikely that we would have a nifi processor which is same as mapreduce processor.
As processor is not usually used for heavy transformations/analysis on data in NiFi.
Nifi is for routing and moving data to right place and giving lot of metadata and tracking information.
We want to keep nifi clusters small as each node in nifi cluster is communicating with other nodes
very frequently & passing lot of data back and forth.
Ex: say if you are reading from an HTTP end point ,downloading data every day, consuming data
as its published and data is quite large say geo tagging data , or pulling image stream from
couple of cameras and you want to merge that data ,
& based on ip we got the video feed from, we want to find out
-where on earth that ip is registered
-apply longitude and latitude information
-want to pull weather feed and add metadata into attributes and do some ml analysis and 
find if these cameras tend to fail between some temperatures.
Say we have 5-7 nodes cluster with primary node having processor that pulls data from stream
,load balances that data throughout the cluster and send 1/5th data to each node, flow on each node is
identical and exactly same.
if we had 200 nodes, would create too much bandwidth requirement and heart beat processing.
thus having 2 or more clusters with side by side communication between 2 coordinators 
would be a better choice.

PQ2:
flow file repository
(is it duplicated or all nodes or distributed in pieces)
 FFR on a specific nodes tracks the flowfiles that have gone through that node.

PQ3:Content repository used local file system or can use network attached storage or some
other volumes.

PQ4:Wait and notify processors : to send data to external system and wait for data to come back, we could 
use wait-notify pattern
we could also have 2 disparate flow segments
	1.that reads from xml log files, transforms data into JSON, puts it to scipy (3 processors in flow)
	2.decoupling two nifi flows and these flows don't talk to each other

Work options:

HDF DataFlow Sandbox
Apache nifi setup on Ubuntu/centos
HDP platform setup and Nifi as a service
