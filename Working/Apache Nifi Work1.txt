Apache Nifi: Notes
-----------
Understanding configurations
Name:
1st & fundamental property of processor is the 'name' property.
We can give a more meaningful name for this.
for ex : getFile ---Get file from Source
Once the flow becomes dense, this property will helps us to understand the significance of each processor.
Scheduling:
We can schedule a processor to run in regular interval 
Ex: 'Scheduling strategy' can be "time driven"
     Note** we can change this to "cron driven" to use any valid cron expressions.
    'Run schedule' can be "0 secs" [i.e. processor will run continously without any gap]
     Note** we can change this value to "5 secs" to have the processor check every "5 secs".
     Time duration could be in sec/min/hrs/days.
Concurrent Tasks:
No of concurrent tasks that should be scheduled using 'concurrent tasks'
-----------------------------
Example 1: Using GetFile & PutFile
------------------------------
Example 2: Using GenerateFlowFile & LogAttribute
GenerateFlowFile processor : to create flowfiles with random data/custom data.
Usually used for conducting any testing/simulation of actual data flow.(or for other processors/components in Nifi)
LogAttribute : logs the attributes of flow file. This can also be used for valid termination of any flow.
Steps:
--to add this processor > click on processor icon and drag and drop on canvas
--search for GenerateFlowFile and add it.
--similarly add LogAttribute
--establish connection between them (check for number of relationships the connection has 
For ex: 'For relationship' "success"
--if LogAttribute shows --relationship is invalid-- via an alert sign,
click on settings for LogAttribute and select 'Automatically Terminate Relationships' "success"
--Let's also change 'Run schedule' "10 secs" for GenerateFlowFile
--start the processors
--what if change the 'Concurrent tasks' for GenerateFlowfile. For ex: 'Concurrent Tasks' "5"
--Make the changes and start the processor. Check if the 'Queued' changes.
  'Concurrent Tasks' spawns the configured number of tasks in parallel and process the flowfiles in parallel.
--Let's also look at properties specifc to each processor and use '?' i.e. tool tip to know more about each property
-------------------
Example 3: 
To clear flowfiles in queue> right click on queue and 'empty queue'
To see the content and attributes of flowfiles in the queue > 
--update GenerateFlowFile configuration
  File size: 1B
  Unique FlowFiles : True
  Scheduling > Run Schedule : 0 secs
--Start the GenerateFlowFile processor
--Look into queue > right click > 'list queue'
--Click on information icon for any of the flowfile to look for details
--click on Attributes to look at attributes of a flow file.
  Attributes of a flowfile vary based on origin of flowfile and based on previous processor this flowfile has been through.
  We can also have custom attributes to flowfiles.
--We notice the queued flowfiles stop at '10000'
Note** In Nifi each processor takes different time to process a flowfile based on complexity involved.
For ex: A 'route on attribute' processor will be faster to 'covert record' processor or 'hash content' processor.
As routing is simpler than converting an entire flowfile content.
Each connection can have its back pressure defined. Look into settings for the queue >
Back Pressure 
'Object threshold' "10000"
'Size threshold'
NIFI stops if either of the configuration reaches first. we can check this by changing file size.
Back pressure avoids data over loads and memory overloads because  backpressure configuration passes through multiple processors
once threshold is reached.
