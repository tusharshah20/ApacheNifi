Apache Nifi: Notes
-----------
Example 4: Manipulating attributes and content of flowfile using available processors in Nifi
--Add a GenerateFlowFile processor
--configure it to generate random data every 5 secs of size 1b 
[File size: 1B, Unqiue FlowFiles : true, Run Schedule: 5 sec]
--Add a ReplaceText processor (updates the content of a flowfile by evaluating a regular expression against it,
and replaces the section of content that matches regular expression with some alternate value)
--establish the connection between these. (Relationships: Success)
--view and edit configuration of ReplaceText processor.
'Replacement Strategy' : used to match regular expression and replace matched value with alternate value
                         can match any string literal and replace it another value
                         can completely replace the content of flowfile with the replacement value without matching it with 
			 regular expression or a string literal
                         can be used to prepend or append ur text to content of flowfile.
note** if a value of property selected, it may make other property obsolete.
For example: selecting 'replacement strategy': "Always replace" makes 'Search Value':"irrelevant"
Similarly append/prepend property will change the way the value is appended(to entire flowfile or to each line in flowfile) based on
evaluation mode property.
'Maximum buffer size' : defines the max size of flowfile to be buffered before processing it.If limit 
exists, flowfile goes to failure relationship path.
'Character Set': shows the character set used for encoding.
'Search value': Takes a regular expression/string literal which will be used to compare the flowfile content & replace it
with the value available in 'replacement value' property.

#to replace content in flowfiles with csv say a,b,c,d
'Replacement Strategy': 'Always Replace'
'Replacement Value': a,b,c,d

#to logically end the flow, we will add LogAttribute processor
--add LogAttribute processor
--create connection from ReplaceText to LogAttribute with 'For Relationships':'success' & 'failure'
<right click on canvas and refresh>
Now
--start GenerateFlowFile > check if flowfiles are generated and queued up> list queue> view contents of a flowfile
--stop GenerateFlowFile
--start ReplaceText > check the content of flowfiles now and see if content was replaced with 'a,b,c,d'
(here the size of content changes as ReplaceText replaces the content as per replacement value)

Now add one more processor i.e. ExtractText Processor (used to extract contents from flowfiles into 1/more flowfile attributes)
To do so, we can add a new property to processor and assign a regular expression to it.
--Add ExtractText
Configure it==
	--add a new property : properties > + csv
	--assign its value to [(.+),(.+),(.+),(.+)] (this will extract,split and assign the values of flowfile content into 
                                a flowfile attribute 'csv']
--connect ReplaceText with ExtractText
--create new connection between ExtractText to LogAttribute with For Relationships: Matched
--also configure ExtractText to autoterminate for 'unmatched'
--start ExtractText (here the size of content doesnt change as ExtractContent only extract content to attributes without
                     altering the actual content)
Now let's look at list of attributes
right click on connection between ExtractText and LogAttribute> list queue > queue content > attributes 
viewing content of flowfiles confirms that there was no alteration done.
