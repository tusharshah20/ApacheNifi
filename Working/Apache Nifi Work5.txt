Add a processor

Drag the processor on canvas and look in source 
<shows all groups , org.apache.nifi and all processors avai>
processor 1
GenerateFlowFile
( we can read from any source,however we will generate some data)

processor shows 
-name
-version
-nifi-standard-nar(nifi archive same as jar/war i.e. collection of actual code &
 functionalities)
-warning icon (might show its not valid)

<right click on alert sign and choose configure>
<settings>
Name: give a name
Penalty Duration: if a flowfile doesnt get processed correctly,
how long should it wait before it tries again.
Yield Duration: How should i try and process before i yield my 
resources to next thread.
Bulletin level: bulletins are information or warning messages
that can popup

<scheduling>
Scheduling strategy: timer driven/cron driven
run schedule: set time
concurrent tasks: assign how many concurrent tasks can run
execution: all nodes/primary node

<properties>
Custom text: something....

Add a custom attribute
Give a name: parity
${now():format('$$$'):mod(2)}

Now lets add one more processor
processor 2
PutFile
<writes the content of flowfile into a file
on local filesystem>

drag the connection from 1st processor to this one.
<backpressure> 
is to inform other processors sending data
to slow down if threshold is reached.

configure putfile settings

processor 3
LogAttribute
<can be used to end flows and see what is happening>

details

for success
for failure

settings
autoterminate relationships

log payload: true
------------
now create one more flow
processor 1
GetFile

configure

mention the file name/directory name
create directory in nodes

processor 2
RouteOnAttribute
<we will use the property we created to decide on how processing is done>
properties> routing strategy > route to property name
Add a property: odd
 ${parity:equals(1)}
Add a property: even
 ${parity:equals(0)}

drag relationships to even n odd logattribute.

processor 3
LogAttribute

<configure>
log payload : yes
name: log odd timestamps

processor 4
LogAttribute
<configure>
log payload : yes
name: log even timestamps

Add one more processor (updateAttribute) after generateFlowFile
<settings>
+ to add property --> filename 
${UUID()}
--------
start the flow from generateflowfile (do a list queue) >updateattribute
putfile-logattribute : set back pressure

After testing delete the relationship between putfile and logattribute as it was for both success and failure
and create 2 relationships: 1 for success and 1 for failure.
